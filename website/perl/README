tree.pl walks through a directory and builds a HTML list of all
files. The files' <title> tags are taken as the linked text, and 
if there is no <title> tag, the filename is used.

How to use this software

    1. On Unix, check if the path to perl in the very first line 
       of tree.pl is correct.
    2. Go to the configuration section in tree.pl and modify the values if 
       necessary.
       Note that the most important values are at the top, so if something
       fails the error is probably there.
    3. On Unix, set execute permission: chmod u+rx tree.pl
    4. -Call the script from command line: ./tree.pl <directory> >sitemap.html
       -Or copy tree.pl and tree-template.html to your cgi-bin
        directory and set execute permissions for the web server
        (chmod u+rx tree.pl or, if that fails, chmod a+rx tree.pl).
        Set $conf::cgi = 1 in the configuration section.
        Set $conf::basedir_cgi to the directory that you want to list.
        Call it in your browser: http://domain.com/cgi-bin/tree.pl
        If it fails with "Internal Server Error", please see the server's 
        error log for a detailed error message.
    5. Optionally edit tree-template.html to modify the look of the 
       generated file.
