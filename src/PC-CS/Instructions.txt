Wockets PC code (written in c sharp) for Wocket setup and calibration, data merging (of multiple Wockets data and other sensors), and data visualization. 

At the moment there are also some other utility functions being used in MIT/Northeastern/Stanford work that assist with device timesyncing in lab experiments. Eventually that code will be removed from here.

The merger will merge Wockets data as well as older data formats used at MIT (MITes).
